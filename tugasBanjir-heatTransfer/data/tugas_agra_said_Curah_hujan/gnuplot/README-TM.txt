* Notes *
********************************************************************************
From 2010-03-19, the renamed fontconfig utlity 'fc-list-gp.exe' is attached.
Original name of this file 'fc-list.exe'. The reason why I rename this file is
to avoid the possibility of confliction other 'fc-list.exe' files on provided in 
other applications.
(e.g. XeTeX )

In the use of 'fc-list-gp.exe', the current directory is set where gnuplot is 
installed. This ulitilty outputs a list of fonts managed by the fontconfig 
library used in this gnuplot distribution.  The list is coded in the utf-8 format. 
Please use redirection like

gnuplot> !fc-list-gp > fc-list.txt
gnuplot> !notepad fc-list.txt

********************************************************************************
From 2010-03-23, dependency libraries are updated and built myself as possible.
(The GLib, cairo, and Pange are still imported from 
http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html')

The most important chage is the replacement of libgd.  The previous library has 
bugs.  The most serious bug is related the fontconfig libraries.  Owing to the 
bug, the old syntax of font setting the gd related terminals (png, jpeg, and gif) 
is not allowed.  Only new syntax (syntax for wxt, pngcairo, and pdfcairo), which
is based on the fontconfig technology.  The fix of the bug of libgd allow to use 
the old and new syntax for gd related terminals.

On July 5, a bug from inconsistency between the libjpeg and the libgd is fixed.
