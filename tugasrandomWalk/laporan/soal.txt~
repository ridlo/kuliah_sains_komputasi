A hiker without a compass trying to find the way in the dark 
can step in any of eight directions (N, NE, E, SE, E, SW, W, NW)
eith each step. Studies show that people tend to veer to the right 
under such circumstances. Initially, the hiker is facing north.
Suppose at each step probabilities of going in the indicated directions
are as follows: N-19%, NE-24%, E-17%, SE-10%, S-2%, SW-3%, W-10%, NW-15%. 
Develop a simulation to trace a path of hiker, and run the simulation a number
of times. Describe the results. (Note that other than at the initial step, 
this simulation simplifies the problem by ignoring the direction in which
the hiker faces.)
